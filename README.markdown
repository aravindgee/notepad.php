Notepad.php
===========

No nonsense notetaking. Useful in the following scenarios:
* You want a utility just like cat or Windows Notepad.
* You want it to be ubiquitous.
* You want to jot down something at work, where services like GoogleDocs and Evernote are blocked.
* You want to take notes from shared computers, such as those in Cyber Cafes without the risk of having you "real" notetaking accounts compromised.
* You want to host the data yourself.
* You want it to be smooth to set up.

Quick, but by no means secure. Please use your descretion while using Notepad.php.
